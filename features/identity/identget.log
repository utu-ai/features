[36m@identity @identity_get[39m
Feature: Search identity

  With proper credentials
  return the proper view of an identity
  scoped to tin, bronze, gold, or silver

  Why:
  - tons of applications of how we could externalize what we know about an identity for 3rd party services

  Rules:
  - need to be very locked down to make sure we only give access to proper requests.  Fatal place for leaks.
