[36m@event @receive_event[39m
Feature: new event

  All valid events
  should be captured,
  persisted,
  associated to a singular identity,
  and denormalized back to identity

  Why:
  - Events are the data that fuels our AI
  - We support an infinite range of types to try and 3-d model consumer behavior

  Rules:
  - Every event must be associated to a singular identity and session

  Components:
    Identity
    Event
